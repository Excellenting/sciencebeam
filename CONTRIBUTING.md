# Ideas

There are many aspects you could improve:

* Conversion step, e.g.:
  * Paragraph detection
  * Formula extraction
  * Table extraction
* [Computer Vision Model](https://github.com/elifesciences/sciencebeam-gym/wiki/Computer-Vision-Model) ([issue #1](https://github.com/elifesciences/sciencebeam-gym/issues/1))
* Training Data:
  * The training data should include PDF and full text XML
  * Public data is preferable as it can then be shared; but we are also looking to partner with publishers that may not be able to make their data public but can provide it for training purpose
* Training Data preparation:
  * We are using the XML to annotate the PDF characters; that works reasonably well but still needs improving.
* Community
* Your ideas here
